# Meow or Not: A foray into computer vision

In these jupyter notebooks, I've explored detection and classification techniques in computer vision.

## Table of Contents

1. Object Detectors in Dlib
	1. Off-the-shelf face detection
		1. HOG-based
		2. CNN-based
	2. Custom-trained HOG-based Meow face detector

Here's a demo of live detection from my webcam:
