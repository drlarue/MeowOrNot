# Meow or Not: A foray into computer vision

In these jupyter notebooks, I've explored detection and classification techniques in computer vision.
For data, I took advantage of the absurd number of photos I've taken of my cat, Meow.

## Examples

Here's a live demo of my Meow face detector (dlib):

The Meow classifier (keras) performed quite well:

Here are some examples of how the model can even distinguish Meow from very similar looking cats:

The model can't get this one though -- can you?
